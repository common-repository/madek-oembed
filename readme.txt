Add medienarchiv.zhdk.ch as a trusted oEmbed provider.


== Description ==

Embedding from Madek will work out of the box with any WordPress (via "oEmbed Discovery"),
but for security reasons some functionality is disabled then, namely fullscreen.

This plugin adds `medienarchiv.zhdk.ch` as a trusted provider,
so embeds form this domain will work load faster and unencumbered.


== Installation ==

Installing "madek-oembed" can be done either by searching for "madek-oembed" via the "Plugins > Add New" screen in your WordPress dashboard, or by using the following steps:

1. Download the plugin via WordPress.org
1. Upload the ZIP file through the 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' screen in your WordPress dashboard
